I am looking for anyone who is willing to help me finish bulding this.

This is a social network that's built with Astro JS and can be ran on Vercel.

A lot needs to be done with this so it can go into production.

Download this repo, run it locally or install it on Vercel and take a look at it.

Please don't change the UI. That part is fine...It's just the functionality and features that needs work.

You can create an account right now so you can view the site.

You can also comment in the "issues" section if you're interested.

Thanks
