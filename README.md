I am looking for anyone who is willing to help me finish bulding this.

This is a social network that's built with Astro JS and can be ran on Vercel.

A lot needs to be done with this so it can go into production.

Download this repo, run it locally or install it on Vercel and take a lot, and figure out what all needs to be done to make it totally function.

Please don't change the UI. That part is fine...It's just the functionality that needs work.

Thanks
